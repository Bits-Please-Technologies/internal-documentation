# Project Development Pipeline

## Prerequisites
This development pipeline includes the following topics:

1. **Requirements gathering.**
2. **User stories.**
3. **Design and development.**
4. **CI/CD**
	5. **Continuous integration (CI).**
	6. **Continuous delivery (CD).**
7. **Deployment.**


## Requirements Gathering
This step involves gathering and documenting the requirements for the project from stakeholders such as customers, end-users, and project team members.

### Requirements Process

1.  **Identify stakeholders:** Identify the people or groups who will be impacted by the project and who will have a stake in its success. This could include customers, end-users, project team members, and management.
2.  **Hold meetings:** Schedule meetings with the stakeholders to gather their requirements. During these meetings, use techniques such as interviews, questionnaires, and focus groups to gather information.
3.  **Document requirements:** Document all requirements gathered from the meetings in a clear and concise manner. This could include using tools such as user stories, use cases, or requirements matrices.
4.  **Prioritize requirements:** Determine the priority of each requirement based on its importance to the project and the stakeholders. This will help the development team focus on the most critical requirements first.
5.  **Review requirements:** Review the gathered requirements with the stakeholders to ensure that they are accurate and complete. This step also involves getting feedback and making revisions as necessary.
6.  **Approve requirements:** Once the requirements have been reviewed and approved by all stakeholders, they can be used as the basis for the project's design and development.
7.  **Keep requirements updated:** As the project progresses, it is important to keep the requirements updated to reflect any changes or new information. This should be done regularly and with the participation of stakeholders.

## User Stories
Once the requirements are gathered, they can be translated into user stories, which describe the functionality of the project from the user's perspective.

## Design & Development
This step involves designing the system and developing the code. Automated testing should be integrated into this step to ensure that the code is working as expected.

###  Testing
## CI/CD
### Continuous Integration
Once the code is developed, it should be integrated into a shared repository, where it can be tested and reviewed by the development team. This step also involves setting up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment process.

### Continuous Deployement
This step involves automating the deployment of the code to different environments such as development, staging, and production.

## Deployment
The final step is to deploy the code to the production environment, where it can be used by the end-users.
